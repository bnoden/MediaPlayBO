NOTE: The shuffle/sort button only works BEFORE playing videos, it crashes after/during.

2. button graphics DONE (simple, but I made them all by myself with no help in MS Paint)
3. playlist DONE
4. shuffle HALFWAY DONE (too much time was spent on this part)
5. progress bar !ENOUGH_TIME
6. total/elapsed time display !ENOUGH_TIME
7. design/color scheme
8. MyButtons class/other classes for clean code !ENOUGH_TIME
9. Handle exceptions !ENOUGH_TIME
